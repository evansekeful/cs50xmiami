# Objectives
1. Understand fundamental programming constructs
2. Design an interactive game in Scratch


# Summary
Scratch is a visual "programming language" developped by MIT that helps teach programming concepts by visually representing them as puzzle pieces. This problem set was due before the first class session.
# Conclusion
I had a lot of fun building this, which includes some custom graphics. It's a little buggy, but I feel that would be due to Flash rather than the game construct itself. [Enjoy! :)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/113206110/)
