# Objectives
1. Accustom you to reading someone elseâ€™s code.
2. Introduce you to larger programs and programs with multiple source files.
3. Empower you with Makefiles.
4. Implement a party favor.

# Summary
In this problem set, we were introduced to search and sort and implemented a game I personally found difficult to solve irl as a child.
# Conclusion
The most I got out of this was the wonderful world of GDB, which I understood the power of immediately coming from a background of customer service. For instance, in some of the more cryptic customer issues that arise, you have to reconstruct the narrative from point A to the problem, which translates directly into debugging.
I wish I had a stronger understanding of how to build make files as well, but given that this is an introductory course, that skill is at least available on my growing "TODO" list.
