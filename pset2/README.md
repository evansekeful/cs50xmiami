# Objectives
1. Become better acquainted with functions and libraries.
2. Dabble in cryptography.

# Summary
Both of the programs dealt heavily with an introduction to the concept of string manipulation, which is definitely one of my strengths and I feel meantally prepared me to deal with all the fun ways to play with strings in Python.
# Conclusion
This was one of the first psets where I had started to get a handle of my own debugging workflow, including small tests and using the print function, that would come in handy later on.
