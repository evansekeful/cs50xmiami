# CS50xMiami Cohort 5 at Miami-Dade College

CS50xMiami is an in-person program that includes the CS50x MOOC course work as well as an additional language concentration. This repo contains my completed work for the CS50x portion of the course, as well as descriptions of what each problem set (AKA "pset") accomplishes.
For an overview of my thoughts on CS50, I invite you to read my blog post on the subject:

## Please Note
All work is provided in it's entirety, including the distribution code provided by CS50, Copyright © 2015 – 2016, David J. Malan of Harvard University. However, I have not included the C libraries that are exclusively provided as "training wheels" for earlier problem sets. Includes of "cs50.h" indicate that this library was used.
The "Objectives" and "Summary" summary sections provided in each pset README file will indicate which portions of the source code were written by me.
