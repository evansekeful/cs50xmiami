# Objectives
1. Get comfortable with IDE
2. Create simple programs in C

# Summary
The first program the problem spec had us write was, naturally, the ever prevelant "Hello, world!" in C. The problems were designed to help students transition into writing C programs in the cloud-based Ubuntu IDE.

The first problem to be submitted for credit is water.c, AKA "Smart Water." Here we had to write a program that would calculate how many bottles of water were used while showering given the length of the shower in minutes. We were provided with the formula, ("So taking a 1-minute shower is akin to using 192 รท 16 = 12 bottles of water.") and the solution was implemented in C.

The second problem, mario.c, would be a recurring theme in the CS50 quizzes. Here we had to take a user input for the height of the Mario Bros "pyramid," and the program would then print a pyramid in hashes that height.
# Conclusion
This was a pretty simple pset that I managed to finish within an afternoon. Although the completion time was a bit misleading for future problems, it did give the feel of what would be expected from the course. For the most part, much of the learning would occur during the problem sets. For instance: nested loops and decrementing were introduced in mario.c.
